# gd-game

This is a 2D game developed using the Godot Engine. The player controls a main character whose goal is to collect coins and earn points while avoiding enemy characters. If the player collides with an enemy, the game ends.

The project demonstrates implementation of core game development concepts such as player movement, collision detection, score system, and game-over mechanics. The game logic is structured using scenes and scripts, following Godot’s node-based architecture.
